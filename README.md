### create

Creates MDN pages based on the submitted flags and arguments.

**Syntax:** `create [-i interface] [-c] [-o] [-a[memberName pageType]]`

**Flags:**

* `-i`: The name of the parent interface for the pages you are creating. This flag does not create an interface.
* `-p`: Indicates that an *interface* page should be created.
* `-c`: Indicates that a *constructor* page should be created.
* `-o`: Indicates that an *overview* page should be created.
* `-a`: Indicates the name and page type of an interface member. The arguments to this flag may be repeated as many times as needed.
* `-it`: Indicates the the interface implements `iterable`. This means pages will be created for methods named `entries()`, `forEach()`, `keys()`, and `values()`.

**Supported page types**

The following `pageTypes` are supported by the `-a` argument.

* event
* handler
* method
* onevent
* property

### clean

### help

## Examples

**Create an interface page only**

`npm run create -i Widget -p`

**Create an interface page and a constructor page**

`npm run create -i Widget -p -c`

**Create a method page without its interface**

`npm run create -i Widget -a "make()" method`

**Create an interface page and two members**

`npm run create -i Widget -p -a "make()" method ready property`

**Create iterable pages**

The following command creates pages for methods named `entries()`, `forEach()`, `keys()`, and `values()`, but not an overview page.

`npm run create -i Widget -it`
