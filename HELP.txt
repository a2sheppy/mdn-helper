  build searchString -- [(-j | --jsonOnly)]
    Builds an interfaces boilerplates after selecting an IDL file based on
    searchString. For interfaces, this also outputs BCD if a file doesn't exist.
    Use -j or --jsonOnly to create a new JSON boilerplate for the browser
    compatibility data database, but no draft MDN pages.

  burn bcd -- burn bcd -- [(-c | --category) _category_] [(-b | --browsers) _browsers_]
  burn chrome  -- [(-f | --flags)] [(-o | --origin-trials)]
  burn urls -- burn urls -- [(-c | --category) _category_]
    Builds several types of burn-down lists.

    The first syntax generates a csv listing BCD entries where the browser
    value is either null or missing. 'category must be one of 'api', 'css',
    'html', 'javascript', or 'svg'. If you don't enter one of these values, you
    will be prompted for one of them.

    The second generates a csv listing Chrome APIs that are lacking an MDN
    page. Use -f or --flags to include APIs behind a flag.

    The last generates a csv listing BCD entries that are lacking a
    corresponding MDN page.

  clean
    Deletes selected folders from the *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  css -- -n propertyName
    Creates a page for a CSS property. The results are written to the
    *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  find searchString
    Searches Chrome's IDL files for filenames matching the provided string,
    prompts you to select a specific file, then displays the contents of that
    file.

  header -- -n headerName [(-H | --header)] [(-d | --directive) directiveName]
    Creates pages for the provided HTTP header and directive names
    names. The results are written to the *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/
    directory. To build directive plages only, exclude the -H or --header flag.

  interface -- -n _interfaceName_ [-o] [-l] [-r] [-it] [-mp] [-mr]
  [(-e | --event) _eventName_] [(-h | --handler) _handlerName_]
  [(-m | --method) _methodName_] [(-p | --property) _propertyName_]
    Creates pages for JavaScript platform APIs. The results are written to the
    *path/to*/mdn-helper/out/ directory.

  update-data
    Downloads a new set of IDL files for use by the `build`, `burn`, and `find`
    commands. You should run this command about once a week to keep your IDL
    files up-to-date.

  help
    Prints help text to the console.

The README file provides more details including full descriptions of the flags.
